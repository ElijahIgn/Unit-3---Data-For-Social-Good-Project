# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a music label company , <br> 
> I want to put more musicians  under our label, <br> 
> so that I can make more money. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Example: 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions 
- **Country** (String) - name of the country 
- **Population** (int) - number of people in the country 
- **CO2Emissions** (double) - carbon dioxide emission in kilotons

## Description 

Our project uses a dataset that gets the top songs from Spotify. It provides us the information that we want or need to determine whether or not we would like to offer them a contract under our label. We coded a program that would tell us the information of the top artists and songs, it would print that information in an organized manner. We did this by coding a way for us to traverse the 1d arrays and then print the respective information of each index.
